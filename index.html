            <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

				<figcaption>Two bar charts compairing two different measures</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>[-1] For this preposition I chose to put the two data points on separate charts because I wanted the audience to take some time between looking at the two measures. If they were overlapping each other, it would be much more obvious if there was a correlation. This was a deceiving choice because I am trying to draw the attention from the reader away from their correlation.</li>
				<li>[1] Furthermore, since I was trying to show that the change in abortion clinics did not have an effect on the abortion rates, I filtered by most negative changes to most positive changes to show that there is no correlation between the two. If I had not done this, and organized the graph based on alphabetical order, the graph would be very complicated and make it difficult for the reader to comprehend the relationship between these two measures. On top of this, with one measure filtered, it also offers the reader information on which states have more change in abortion clinics than the others. I tried to stay earnest with this choice as I was simply trying to make the graph easier to read. </li>
				<li>[-2]Lastly, I choose these measures because they are not in the same unit. Although they are both changes in some factor, one is clinics and the other is abortion rate. They look very similar on the axis and without furthermore noticed looks they are expressing the information in the same units. However since the change in the number of abortion clinics is not relative to the state itself but instead to the entire data set, this is deceiving because although it looks like there is no correlation between the two in the measures, we cannot conclude this because they are actually different units. </li>

            <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

            <figure>

				<figcaption>Barchart orgniazed from negative to postive percent change</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>[2]For this visualization I want the reader to see a clear correlation between percent of abortions and percent of number abortion clinics. To do this, I combined the two measures on the same chart and labeled them with different colors to diminish them. With this choice the readers can clearly see that for most states, a higher percent of abortions were often associated with higher percent of abortion clinics and they were on the same side of the zero. Most of the states who had a positive percent change in abortion rates and a negative percent change in abortion clinics and vice versa were all in the middle where change was not significant compared to the ends. By doing this, I think it was a lot easier for the audience to associate these two measures as having a correlation. If I put them on two graphs where the reader has to look back and forth between the graphs, some of the connection could be lost during this process. </li>
				<li>[2]For this visualization, I also choose to filter them from most negative percent change to most positive percent change. Leaving them in the default alphabetical order will not provide much more data to the reader whereas sorting them will allow us to see how abortion rates and abortion clinic rates for each state compare to the states next to them on the chart. This was also simply a choice to stay organized so there was no deceiving. </li>
				<li>[2]Because the goal for this chart was to be as earnest as possible, I chose the same units for both of the measures. In the previous chart I had one percent change and one change in numbers. Here, I have them both in percent changes because this way the chart can account for various populations depending on the states. Undestabdinbly, larger states should have more people getting abortions and abortion clinics simply because there are most people living in that state. To get rid of this factor so we can purely look at the relationship between abortion rates and abortion clinic rates, I choose to use percent change which would be independent of population in that state. </li>

                <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

                <p>
					The overall design process across both visualizations was very difficult for me because I had to debunk my own statement. After making my first visualization, it was very difficult to find a way to depict the data in a way that supports the opposite claim. At a certain point, I had to go back to the data set to assess what were the best measures to use. I also went on to the New York Times and looked at the visualizations that they had for some inspiration. What surprised me the most was how many different visualizations that I was able to create with this data set. 

				</p>
				<p>
					The data set itself was also very surprising to me. In some areas where I did not expect to have a lot of data like Abortion rate (the no. of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-19, 18-19 and 15-19, by state of residence, 2017. I think I would be able to calculate some of this data from the data set and some of it was unnecessary. This is because despite the extensive data on abortions for women of various age groups, some even overlapping the other, there was no data on any of the years between 2017 - 2020 in % change in abortion rate. There were many states like Oklahoma who had 100 percent change in abortion rate which would be interesting to explore more if we had the years in between 2017-2020. 
				</p>
					In terms of “ethical analysis and visualization” I think the line is blurring between ethical and unethical more and more. Actions including manipulating the raw data sets are completely unethical since that is presenting untrue information to the public. However, just like in articles and books where the author is trying to make the audience agree with their view, data visualization is similar in this sense as the author is trying to make the audience see certain patterns in the data. I think certain manipulations like color choice, and words chosen in titles and labeled axes are acceptable as long as they are not being labeled as something they are not or presenting misinformation. Like I said above, I don’t think there is a bound that can be drawn. There are many easy ways that data visualization can become deceiving whether intentionally or unintentionally. Because of these unclear bounds between acceptable persuasive choices and misleading ones, the audience should also do their jobs in fact checking what is presented in front of them.
